# Internship for the social entrepreneurship called Anou
##The Task
- Design a responsive link tree page that is similar to instagram's current design. The link to this webpage would be hosted in an instagram bio link and take you to an external page. The page would contain images pulled from a backend database and link the user to Anou's store for the artisan so that the user could buy the unique handmade item the image referenced. This design was meant to contain as little text as possible to bridge the technical and linguistic gap between the artisans and the potential buyers.
